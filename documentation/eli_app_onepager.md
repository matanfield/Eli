# **Eli — Just speak**

### **The Idea**

Eli is the simplest way to learn a language: by **talking**. No lessons, no menus, no gamified points — just natural personalized conversation with an AI instructor. You open the app and Eli speaks with you, like a personal tutor or a friendly companion. Eli will understand your purpose — which language and for what usage, and will naturally propose the next step, adapting with your feedback. Eli may propose you a sentence to repeat, breaking it down to the smallest components, helping you to repeat them one by one and altogether. Eli will show you similarities to or distinctions from other languages you already know, will talk with you naturally, remember past conversations and adapt the teaching to your very personal progress.  

### **Why Eli**

- **Audio-first, conversation-only**: pure dialogue, no distractions.
- **Alive and personal**: Eli feels like a real instructor, confident and reassuring, yet warm and approachable.
- **Consistency**: Eli remembers you, your progress, and past conversations. Conversations may touch upon your natural points of life. Eli feels like meeting a real instructor.
- **AI-native design**: instead of adapting classroom methods into an app, Eli starts from what AI does best — fluid, adaptive conversation.
- **Frictionless**: one tap, and you’re talking.

### **Unique Value Proposition**

Traditional apps drill vocabulary or grammar. Eli immerses you directly in **spoken practice** — the hardest skill to develop, and the one learners need most. By making every session a real conversation, Eli collapses the gap between “studying” and “using” the language. Learning a new language with Eli is effortless and fun. Some say it can become addictive.

### **Features (v1 vision)**

- **Instant conversation**: open the app, Eli greets you and starts talking.
- **Speech-to-speech loop**: you talk, Eli listens, replies in natural voice.
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Eli adjusts tone, vocabulary, and speed to your level.
- **Gender-flexible persona**: Eli can be male or female, depending on your preference.
- **Session memory**: remembers accumulating context — both short-term during a session and long-term points about progress (sentences learnt) and about you (life points).
- **Minimal interface**: no text, no buttons — just Eli speaking with you.

### **The Brand**

- **Name**: *Eli* — short, international, approachable, gender fluid.
- **Voice**: confident yet warm; a guide who makes you feel safe speaking.
- **Personality**: not a classroom teacher, not a chatbot — but a conversational partner or casual instructor who helps you *practice for real life*.
